# Liferay REST Example

This example project shows how to create REST services using the JAX-RS technology.
This project also covers:
* How to wrap some exception thrown by your code to customize the REST service response.
* How to check if a User has permission to view any Journal Article (Liferay PermissionChecker)
* How to read the Journal Articleâ€™s content (SAXReaderUtil)
* How to read property files inside an OSGi module
* How to include external dependencies into the project updating manually the bnd.bnd file (Jackson)

### Prerequisites

* Install JDK
* Install Liferay Developer Studio
* Install, configure and start Liferay DXP

### Build and Deploy

* Clone this repo
* Import the module into Liferay Developer Studio
* Inside the Gradle tab, execute Build & Deploy
* Make sure to copy the generated .JAR ([projectdir]/build/libs) into your Liferay DXP deploy folder

## Endpoints

If the module is installed successfully, new values should appear within CXF Endpoints and Rest Extender settings.

* Control Panel > System > System Settings > Foundation > CXF Endpoints
* Control Panel > System > System Settings > Foundation > Rest Extender

This example uses the endpoint /user (if you are already using this endpoint, the application won't start)


## REST Usage
